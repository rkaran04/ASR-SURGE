# ASR-SURGE

The project was about developing an ASR model for Hindi language and utilizing it for a range of audio 
transcription. The project has been going on for some time with Professor Vipul Arora and 
Prasar Bharati, India’s state-owned public broadcasting. Prasar Bharati have a lot of spoken 
data as they have been offering their services for a long time now. Their extensive array of 
network includes All India Radio-Akashvani and Doordarshan among others. They require an 
ASR model for the extensive transcription of data they have, which is mostly long form audios, 
which posed another challenge. The details of the project will follow later in the report. After 
working and completing tasks at hand with my mentor’s team on this project, the focus again 
shifted to a global ASR challenge, MADASR’23, organized by ASRU and IISC Bangaluru. The 
challenge involved adapting ASR models for low resource Indic Languages-Bhojpuri and 
Bengali.
